LEGOOOO

This chapter is focused on constraints, whether it be in design or in action. Most notably, in the circumstance of the unfamiliar, how can designers design in a way where users can intuit what to do without clear context.

The first and most notable example for me in this chapter has to be the first one because it is lego. I like lego. Itâ€™s expensive as hell though. But in this instance, Don Norman uses lego to demonstrate how people approach a problem or object that they are unfamiliar with through a building test. Using one of the simplest builds(a police motorcycle) which consists of 15 pieces, two of which are symmetrical, Norman asked a few people to build the motorcycle. They were given no instruction. 

	This reminds me of a game that is very similar to lego and even has sets made by them, Minecraft. When playing the game on survival, I had to not only collect resources to survive, I had to figure out where to build a house, the dimensions, the height, the amount of floors, the design, without any form of plan or context, just the materials I gathered on that world.
