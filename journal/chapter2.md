In this chapter of the design of everyday things, Don Norman focuses on the psychology of our actions when it comes to our interactions with objects and how designers can design accordingly. 

The chapter starts with a recount of his time in England renting a house with his family while the owners were away. The landlady came to get some papers, but had trouble opening the file cabinet attempting to open it in a way most would assume it would open, by simply pulling it towards them. Norman then proceeded to open it through the mechanics of it. The landlady proceeded to blame herself for not being able to open the filing cabinet, but it wasn’t really her fault it didn’t work. I find this story interesting as it shows how we can frustrate ourselves when a design doesn’t work as intended.

Something I find very interesting and it relates back to the introduction story was the concept of Learned Helplessness. It’s a phenomenon that after countless failed attempts at an interaction, the user will simply give up. This phenomena can even lead to depression in the most interesting cases. It’s nothing too shameful to experience, but It feels humiliating to not figure something out. I have experienced this feeling countless times through countless products and designs, and many of those times, I have given up. It’s easy to give up, especially when the problem is outside your grasp.
