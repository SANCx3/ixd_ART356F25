# CHAPTER 1 Of DOE

This week’s reading was Chapter 1 of the Design of everyday things. There’s quite a bit to talk about, including some stuff about doors.

## Door Story
In the beginning of this chapter, Don Norman(the Author) starts out the chapter talking about how people tend to put up with the frustrations of using standard everyday objects, he makes it a point to bring up doors, as doors are an object that we are supposed to know well. On page 3, he talks about a friend who went to a European city post office. The entrance of the building was a row of six glass swing doors. The Friend couldn’t figure out how the doors worked. He ended up trapped as the doors didn’t really provide any clue as to how they worked when he was on the other side.
